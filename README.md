# HDH_Game
I worked on this project in a two person team during my stay at Højer Design Højskole (2017). My tasks were gameplay programming, character design, modelling and animation, and world building.  My teammate, Malte, did everything environment. (https://maltefrederiksen.artstation.com/)

The build is a windows build. The project is a little fu*ked right now, since I updated Unity.
